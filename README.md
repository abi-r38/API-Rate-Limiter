# API-Rate-Limiter
A full-stack API Rate Limiter built with Python, Django, and Redis. This project implements the Token Bucket algorithm to enforce request limits on an API endpoint. The frontend, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a real-time, interactive demonstration of the rate-limiting in action.
