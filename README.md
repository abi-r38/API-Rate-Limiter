# API-Rate-Limiter
A full-stack API Rate Limiter built with Python, Django, and Redis. This project implements the Token Bucket algorithm to enforce request limits on an API endpoint. The frontend, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a real-time, interactive demonstration of the rate-limiting in action. A critical component for building robust and scalable systems.


Core Functionality:

Backend: Built with Python and the Django web framework.

Algorithm: Implements the Token Bucket algorithm to handle traffic bursts while enforcing a steady-state limit.

State Management: Utilizes a Redis database for high-performance, low-latency storage of rate-limiting state (tokens and timestamps).

Frontend: A responsive and dynamic user interface built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that visualizes the rate-limiting process in real-time.
This project demonstrates key concepts in system design, backend development with a Python framework, asynchronous JavaScript, and the integration of an in-memory database.
